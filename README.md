# ACM Research coding challenge (Fall 2022)

## Analysis & Solution
My brother, a mechanical engineer who enjoys modifying cars, insisted that a car's performance and reliability directly and positively affects its miles per gallon(MPG). I decided to use his hypothesis to try to predict a car's minimum and maximum MPG based on its listed performance and reliability ratings. I used sklearn's linear regression to attempt to model this relationship in `main.py`.

## Commands
`pip install pandas` `pip install -U scikit-learn` `pip install tk`

## Results
Not every test case I ran was accurate, but many of them were accurate. My solution was able to somewhat predict the range of MPG using some car listings's performance and reliability ratings.

## Improvements
1. I should have used matplotlib to first prove the hypothesis before attempting predictions.
2. There may have been other regression models to better explain the relationship I was testing but were currently out of my learning capabilities within python.
